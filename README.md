This repo contains codes for Principal Component Analysis in machine learning


### Principal Component Analysis in Machine learning  
* PCA is the most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models.  
* PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables.  
* It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit.  
* ML models with many input variables or higher dimensionality tend to fail when operating on a higher input dataset. PCA helps in identifying relationships among different variables & then coupling them.  
* Here, in the code file we have worked on dataset : load_iris, imported from Scikit-learn library.
